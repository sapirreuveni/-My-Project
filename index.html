<h1><b> My life story: </b></h1>
<hr>
<p>
My name is Sapir Reuveni, and I am 22 years old. I grew up in Rishon Lezion, and I have two siblings — a brother and a sister who are 10 years older than me.
I attended Avni Hoshen High School, where I majored in Computer Science (10 units) and Chemistry. The program included learning several programming languages and completing a final project as part of the computer science major.
When I was accepted into the computer science program, I was truly happy, as I have always loved working with computers. Both of my older siblings are also involved in the field, and since a young age I have felt a natural affinity for computers.

<h1><b> Why I Chose QA: </b></h1>
<hr>
<p>
I am passionate about technology and problem-solving, and QA is the perfect combination of both. My background in computer science has given me a solid foundation in programming and logical thinking, while my natural curiosity drives me to explore, test, and improve every detail.
I am detail-oriented, organized, and patient, which allows me to carefully analyze systems and ensure high-quality results. For me, QA is not just about finding bugs — it is about creating better, more reliable products that users can trust.
My motivation to learn and grow, together with my strong technical background, make me confident in my ability to succeed and contribute in the QA field.

I have a variety of hobbies that keep me curious and engaged. I enjoy working with computers and exploring new technologies, as it allows me to learn and improve my skills. I also like watching TV and relaxing with my favorite shows. Spending time with friends and socializing is important to me, and I love going out, trying new activities, and creating fun memories. Traveling and exploring new places with my family is another passion of mine, as it gives me the chance to discover new cultures and experiences.
